<p>Hello! This is our first article on our new blog!</p>
<img src=\"/images/Gopherwatch_League.png\" class=\"blog-image-large\">
<p>This is our first blog post, which will be used to make important league announcements and website updates! You can see that our home page is in progress and we have this snazzy new blog! This is a significant step towards full functionality of the website, and I will outline some of our upcoming changes along with a rough timetable:</p>
<ul>
	<li>League-wide statistics page (6/18/2021)</li>
	<li>Standings and matches viewable per-tournament (6/25/2021)</li>
	<li>Player profile pages with hero stats and other poggers features (7/9/2021)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all I have for you today; have a great week 2 and GL;HF in your upcoming games!</p>
